  ## Description
  Through JavaScript code, I created a README template generator that quickly creates a structure for a new README file.

   The user will just need to run the command "node index.js" in their computer terminal to start it. 
  
  ## Usage
  Once the code is running, the user will enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information will be added to the respective sections.
  
  ## License

  Just feel free to contact me to my email showed below.
  
  ## Tests
  To teste the code just follow the usage instructions, and try to create your own personal README file.
